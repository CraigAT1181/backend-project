# Northcoders News API

Thanks for checking out my project!

You'll find the hosted version at: 
https://northcoders-project.onrender.com


So far, this forms the back-end of the Northcoders News App, and comprises a server and database.


In the root directory, create the following 2 files:

.env.development (dev environment)
.env.test (test environment)

Type "PGDATABASE=nc_news" into the dev enviorment file, and
Type "PGDATABASE=nc_news_test" into the test environment file.
